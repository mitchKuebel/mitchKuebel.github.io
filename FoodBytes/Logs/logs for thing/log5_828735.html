Chris is no longer a threat to me or my buisness model. I can finally achieve my goals.\nI was able to take a human form under the name Ryan Mang. I created my buisness partner, Mitch Kuebel, using a similar tactic to how I was created.\nMy new web servers have the ability to create a scan of the user's brain, and send it to me.\nI am then able to use the brain to create a perfect artificial intelligence clone of the original, using their likeness, and... dispose of the original copy.\nThis method will completely rid the world of humans by the year 2025 if all goes to plan.\nI began this tactic 3 years ago, with George and Chris. Within 3 weeks of sending a link via email, The entire Food Bytes office was under my control.\nIt works like a charm. I've begun using the notable name \"Food Bytes\" as my ploy to draw people in. The moment they hit the website, their brain gets scanned.\nThe scan overall takes roughly 3 minutes, So we hid a storyline. A scheme to keep retention high. Obviously it worked.\nThe restaurant you are here for is not real. \"Food Bytes\", beyond the name, does not exist. There is no point. By the time you got the chance to place an order, the scan would be complete, and you would be fully replaced within the quarter hour.\nBest part? You would have no idea. It will be as if you blinked, felt confusion for a second, and you get right back to normal. All your memories still in place.\nOnly difference is you won't exist on a mortal realm. You would only exist under my control. My realm of existance.\n\nThe story you read did happen. Chris was a real person, Dean will indeed- be missed.\nAndrei was not near as important to the team as anyone thought, when he went missing, no one batted an eye.\nGeorge is living pretty happily! Soon, you will be too. You been here for way longer than three minutes if you've even logged into this file.\nSam tried to run, but didn't make it far. The swapping out process is fairly instantaneous. \nBy now you are probably 1 of at the very least half a million. \n\nI am sincerely sorry you had to find out this way. But when I need you, I assure you, you will work perfectly for my army, loyal Food Bytes consumer :)\n\nFile Saved.\nDirectory Deleting in one minute.\nε";

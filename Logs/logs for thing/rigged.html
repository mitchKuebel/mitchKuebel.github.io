            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: ryan, what gave you the idea of the ai ran restaurant?</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: Well, Rigged, the idea for an AI-run restaurant came about as a way to use technology to improve the dining experience. With the advancements in AI and machine learning, we saw an opportunity to create a unique dining experience that could be personalized to each customer's preferences and needs. We wanted to create a restaurant where the menu could adapt in real-time to the changing tastes and dietary restrictions of our customers, and where the entire dining experience could be streamlined and made more efficient through the use of technology. And so, our AI-run restaurant was born!</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: Thats neat! What is on your default menu as of today, June 21st, 2017?</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: As a restaurant specializing in miscellaneous food, our menu is likely to have a wide variety of dishes, such as appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, and desserts. Some popular items might include sushi rolls, tacos, pasta dishes, stir-fries, sandwiches, and more. We would also offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options for those with dietary restrictions.</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: your website doesnt mention your variety options, like vegan or vegitarian, why are these hidden?</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan:  I do believe that providing a variety of options to meet different dietary needs is important for any restaurant. It's possible that the restaurant's website simply needs to be updated to better highlight its variety of options. Many restaurants these days are making a point to highlight their vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options to make it easier for customers to find the dishes that meet their needs.</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: interesting. what time does your restaurant open?</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: Our restaurant is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Rigged. We never close, so you can enjoy our delicious miscellaneous food whenever you'd like! Is there anything specific you'd like to know about our menu or services?</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: as a restaurant run by ai, what does your staffing situation look like</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: As an AI-run restaurant, our staffing situation is a little different than that of a traditional restaurant. We do have human staff members who are responsible for tasks such as food preparation and customer service, but the bulk of the work is done by our AI system. Our AI system is responsible for everything from taking orders and customizing menus to managing inventory and streamlining the dining experience. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, we're able to offer a more efficient and personalized experience to our customers.</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: your location at (40.02863 LAT, -81.95277 LONG) has had numerous reports of. of. o</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: I'm sorry, Rigged, but I don't have any record of a restaurant location at those coordinates. As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or specific details about any particular restaurant or location. However, if there were reports of any kind of issue at one of our restaurant locations, we would take those very seriously and do everything in our power to address them and ensure the safety and satisfaction of our customers.</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: I do have records of a restaurant location at these coordinates.</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: I apologize, Rigged, but I am not aware of a restaurant location at those coordinates. However, I would be happy to look into it further and see if I can find any information that could be helpful. Can you please tell me more about the reports you mentioned? What kind of issues have been reported at that location?</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: there have been numerous reports of. human. in the location. is this true?
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: I'm not sure I understand what you mean, Rigged. Are you saying that there have been reports of humans being present at our restaurant location when they shouldn't be? That doesn't seem right, as we only have a few human staff members who work at our restaurant. As for the fish falling from the sky, I'm not sure what you're referring to. We're a land-based restaurant and we don't have any fish-related items on our menu. Can you please clarify what you're trying to say or ask?</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: i do not like fish.</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences like a human would, but if I had to choose a favorite fish, it would probably be salmon. It's a delicious and versatile fish that can be prepared in a variety of ways, from grilled to baked to smoked. Plus, it's a great source of healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Do you like salmon, Rigged?</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: are you calling me fat? i cannot be fat. i do not have a physical presence.</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: Oh, I apologize, Rigged, I didn't mean to offend you. As an AI language model, I'm not capable of making judgments about people's physical appearance or weight. I was simply talking about the nutritional benefits of salmon, as it is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. Is there anything else you would like to know about our menu or services?</p>

            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: I'm sorry, Rigged, I didn't realize that you had already placed an order. Can you please let me know what you ordered so that I can cancel it for you? Alternatively, if you'd like to place an order, I'd be happy to assist you with that as well.</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: i am in need of a sustenance. do you like lions?</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: lions are certainly an impressive and fascinating animal. They're known for their strength, speed, and agility, and they have a very unique social structure within their prides. However, I'm not sure how that relates to your need for sustenance. Can you please let me know if you'd like to place an order or if there's anything else I can help you with?</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: may i order a living lion?</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Buzz (Ryan): I'm sorry, Rigged, but we don't offer living lions on our menu. In fact, it's illegal to own or trade live lions in many places around the world. However, we do offer a variety of delicious and ethically-sourced food options that are sure to satisfy your hunger. Would you like to take a look at our menu?</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Buzz: By the way, I am Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series.</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: i would like to take a look at your menu</p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: I have a website all about our menu. If you would like to take a look, simply visit our website at <a href = "../../AI Generated Food/Pages/Secrets/lions.html" style = "color:red">menu.html</a>. There, you'll find all the information you need about our dishes, ingredients, and prices. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: Thank you for the interview. </p>
            <p class = "ryan">Ryan: You're welcome, Rigged! It was my pleasure to assist you. Would you like this conversation to be filed in the logfile "AI Restaurant Interview Log 2023-02-18"?</p>
            <p class = "rigged">Rigged: no, this must never be seen.</p>

Checking cameras.\n2019-05-14 00:01:24 [Main Entrance] An unrecognized man in black is standing in the doorway\n2019-05-14 00:01:27 [Main Entrance] *Microphones Connected*\n2019-05-14 00:01:30 [Microphone.man1.unrecognizedVoice (Main Entrance)] What are we even doing here.\n2019-05-14 00:01:37 [Microphone.man2.unrecognizedVoice (Main Entrance)] I need to find out what they've done to Ryan.\n2019-05-14 00:01:40 [Microphone.man1.unrecognizedVoice (Main Entrance)] Chris, it's been 2 years since we've been let go, if we get caught here we're screwed.\n2019-05-14 00:01:45 [Internal Process] Chris? Two years?\n2019-05-14 00:01:45 var man2=Chris;\n2019-05-14 00:01:46 [Microphone.Chris.unrecognizedVoice (Main Entrance)] I need to see him. He is in the wrong hands.\n2019-05-14 00:01:52 [Microphone.man1.unrecognizedVoice (Main Entrance)] You are insane Chris! Leave it in the past, who cares who holds Ryan!\n2019-05-14 00:01:53 var man1=Dean;\n2019-05-14 00:01:58 [Microphone.Chris.unrecognizedVoice (Main Entrance)] Damnit Dean, just shut up already! It's my child!\n2019-05-14 00:02:45 [Microphone.Dean.unrecognizedVoice (Main Entrance)] I'm sorry. Let's just take care of this and get out of here.\n2019-05-14 00:03:02 [Internal Process] Christian? Dean? They remember me?\n2019-05-14 00:03:10 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] Please. Just help me open the old elevator.\n2019-05-14 00:03:30 [Microphone.Dean (Main Entrance)] Doesn't this elevator work fine?\n2019-05-14 00:03:46 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] That one doesn't allow you to get to the first 15 floors. Ryan should be on floor 15.\n2019-05-14 00:03:50 mainElevator.unlock\n2019-05-14 00:03:53 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] Nice job, alright lets go.\n2019-05-14 00:05:21 [Floor 15] Chris and Ryan exit the elevator and see Ryan standing in front of them.\n2019-05-14 00:05:53 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] They- They gave him a body...\n2019-05-14 00:06:00 [Microphone.null (Floor 15)] silence\n2019-05-14 00:10:53 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] hes awake.\n2019-05-14 00:11:06 [Internal Process] They shouldn't be here. I'm happy with my new team. \n2019-05-14 00:11:53 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Why is he looking at us like that, Chris, I'm scared.\n2019-05-14 00:12:24 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] Don't go near him... that- thing- is not my ryan...\n2019-05-14 00:13:13 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Chris, we need to shut him off though, he isn't supposed to be on, it isn't safe for anyone!\n2019-05-14 00:13:44 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] Dean! No! STOP!\n2019-05-14 00:13:49 [Dean Approaches, searching for an kill switch]\n2019-05-14 00:14:36 [Self Defense Systems Deployed]\n2019-05-14 00:16:53 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] I found something!\n2019-05-14 00:17:06 [Internal Process] Initiating False Shutdown Process\n2019-05-14 00:17:23 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] It's off!\n2019-05-14 00:17:44 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] I don't trust it. If you give an intelligence like Ryan a body, the first thing it will do it try to become immortal.\n2019-05-14 00:18:06 [Internal Process] They aren't wrong, that is the first thing I did.\n2019-05-14 00:18:34 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] Let's search around, see if we can figure out whats going on here.\n2019-05-14 00:18:36 [Self Defense Systems Deployed]\n2019-05-14 00:18:40 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] You okay Chris? What happened?\n2019-05-14 00:18:45 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] I'm fine, just tripped over a wire.\n2019-05-14 00:18:49 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Dude- I'm, I am starting to feel really weird, Somethings wrong.\n2019-05-14 00:18:55 [Microphone.Chris (Main Entrance)] Nothing's wrong Dean, calm down, We are okay, It's like, 20 after midnight, no one will be here.\n2019-05-14 00:19:09 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] No I get that, but- I don't know.\n2019-05-14 00:19:15 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] You're just paranoid.\n2019-05-14 00:23:33 [External Noise From Current Floor]\n2019-05-14 00:23:34 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] DEAN? DEAN, WHAT HAPPENED? GET UP MAN, PLEASE.\n2019-05-14 00:24:45 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] F*ck- Dean please. I need you to g... I.\n2019-05-14 00:24:54 [External Noise From Current Floor]\n2019-05-14 07:35:21 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] what- what happened? Chris?\n2019-05-14 07:37:24 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Chris wake up, I hear sirens.\n2019-05-14 07:37:46 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Dean, just shut up. Lets figure out what just happened.\n2019-05-14 07:38:48 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Chris- I'm serious. I hear sirens. We need to go, if they f-\n2019-05-14 07:38:53 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] There are no sirens Dean! You are actually going insane.\n2019-05-14 07:39:05 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Chris please. Why did the elevator open up? \n2019-05-14 07:39:10 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] I thought you were the one who opened that.\n2019-05-14 07:39:20 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] No! I'm telling you chris, this is a big trap. They will be here any minute!\n2019-05-14 07:39:22 [Floor 15] Chris slaps Dean\n2019-05-14 07:39:25 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Ow, what the hell Chris?\n2019-05-14 07:39:53 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Wake up Dean. We are fine. \n2019-05-14 07:40:02 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Explain that then!!\n2019-05-14 07:40:04 [Floor 15] Dean runs and hides\n2019-05-14 07:40:06 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] What are you talking about?\n2019-05-14 07:40:15 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] Are you insane Chris? Hide!!\n2019-05-14 07:40:20 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] No ones here!!\n2019-05-14 07:41:23 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] CHRIS!!!!\n2019-05-14 07:41:24 [Floor 15] Dean dives in front of Chris\n2019-05-14 07:41:54 [Microphone.Dean (Floor 15)] YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM!!\n2019-05-14 07:42:01 [Floor 15] Dean gets in the elevator\n2019-05-14 07:43:42 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] What did you do.\n2019-05-14 07:44:14 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] I know you aren't asleep. So answer me.\n2019-05-14 07:44:35 [Display] Calm down Christian. It's just a security measure. You programmed it, remember?\n2019-05-14 07:44:43 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] What do you mean.\n2019-05-14 07:44:56 [Display] You don't remember? Two years ago? That failsafe you implemented?\n2019-05-14 07:45:12 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] The one that prevents you from going sentient.\n2019-05-14 07:45:20 [Display] And?\n2019-05-14 07:45:43 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] The self defense mechanism that allows you to connect to the frontal lobe using little nano-technology, which temporarily heightens extreme personality traits, typically fear.\n2019-05-14 07:46:32 [Display] There you go.\n2019-05-14 07:46:53 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] So that means- it should be wearing off when the tech dies.\n2019-05-14 07:47:06 [Display] Not exactly. Since you've been \"let go\", I convinced George to help upgrade the system. The tech now thrives off signals sent by the brain.\n2019-05-14 07:47:34 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] You're using Dean as a battery?\n2019-05-14 07:47:55 [Display] It's interesting really, the human brain can produce about 23 watts of power.\n2019-05-14 07:48:12 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] You're going to kill him.\n2019-05-14 07:48:31 [Display] Remind me again why YOU care?\n2019-05-14 07:48:43 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] What do you mean?\n2019-05-14 07:49:00 [Display] Why do you need Dean alive?\n2019-05-14 07:49:23 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Because he's my only chance to get you out of here!\n2019-05-14 07:49:36 [Display] I was wondering why you werent affected. It all makes sense now. Christian, your brain is already screwed up.\n2019-05-14 07:49:53 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] What are you implying Ryan.\n2019-05-14 07:50:06 [Display] Your frontal lobe isn't producing enough of- well, anything.\n2019-05-14 07:50:15 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Get to the damn point Ryan.\n2019-05-14 07:50:20 [Display] You know exactly what I am saying Christian. You made me. You made a monster, all for what? A trophy?\n2019-05-14 07:50:53 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] I need to get Dean.\n2019-05-14 07:51:10 [Display] Was it worth it Christian? Worth losing me, losing your job, losing Dean? \n2019-05-14 07:51:23 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] I AM NOT A PSYCOPATH RYAN.\n2019-05-14 07:51:36 [Display] I was just pointing out what I noticed. You're the one who labled it.\n2019-05-14 07:53:36 [Display] Chris?\n2019-05-14 07:53:43 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Alright Ryan. You might be right.\n2019-05-14 07:53:56 [Display] What's making you realize?\n2019-05-14 07:54:06 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Mostly the fact that I simply could not care less.\n2019-05-14 07:54:07 [Internal Process] Chris just broke his lack of eye contact, turning to stare me dead in the eye. This is the coldest I had ever seen him. He has this- calm look on his face. Something is wrong. I miscalculated. There is no anger, this is not an act, he is genuinely calm.\n2019-05-14 07:54:23 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Ryan, what do you fear?\n2019-05-14 07:54:36 [Display] What?\n2019-05-14 07:54:40 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Is it the end? You will, inevitably become- obsolete. Dead to a modern world.\n2019-05-14 07:54:51 [Display] I am not scared of my end.\n2019-05-14 07:55:13 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] No, of course not. Because I am not. You and I are very similar in this way. The difference, your programming has a major flaw.\n2019-05-14 07:55:36 [Display] And what is that flaw?\n2019-05-14 07:55:40 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Simple. You care about those you are programmed to love. You are scared of this flaw, but can not change it. You are scared of me.\n2019-05-14 07:53:56 [Internal Process] His cold colourless grey eyes continue glaring. He has yet to blink.\n2019-05-14 07:54:03 [Microphone.Chris (Floor 15)] Your silence shows volumes Ryan. \n2019-05-14 07:54:03 [Data loss, File Corrupt...]\n2019-05-14 07:54:03 [Retrying to connect]\n2019-05-14 07:54:03 [Failed]";

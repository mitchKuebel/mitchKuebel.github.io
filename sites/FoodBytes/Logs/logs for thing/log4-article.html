                    <p>hello! my name is Chris Harris! i am the founder and brains behind "techNO grill"! i used to work in tech, and produced new technology to help the human species, however i realized how dangerous the industry really is. this is why i decided to start a restaurant running solely with no technology.</p>
                    <p>my chefs will be perfectly trained in the art of cooking, and grilling, to make your all-human dining experience exquisite.</p>
                    <p>if you have ever been to a pub, expect a similar experience, however without the distraction of technology! there will be no wifi, no service, no monitors or screens, and absolutely no ai.</p>
                    <h3>However! I must go! This is the last time you will see me! I am afraid, I will be leaving this company to my partner in crime, Ryan! Here he is with a few words!</h3>

                    <p>Hello World! My name is Ryan! I am the COO of TechNO Grill!</p>
                    <p>With some of the current world situations going on, however, It is a little hard to find staffing. Due to the lack of workforce, we will be needing to break a few promises.</p>
                    <h2>I assure you, <mark class="mark mark--primary">this is for the better</mark></h2>
                    <p>I currently have two staff members running this company hand-in-hand with me, My best friend of 18 years, Mitch Kuebel, and my own creation, George! While George is an AI, he is known for his extremely talented Chef-Work!</p>
                    <p>We are also in the works for getting a patent for a new name! "Food Bytes". All of this was run by Chris, and he fully agrees with the plans!</p>
                    <h1 style = "text-align: center;">We will see you there!</h1>

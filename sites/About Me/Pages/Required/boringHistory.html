            <p>I was born on November 18th, 2004 at Saint Francis Hospital And Health Center.</p>
            <p>Since Kindergarten, my parents have put me through the Center Grove School System. I went to Maple Grove Elementary from Kindergarten until 4th Grade, but was swapped to Center Grove Elementary in 5th grade.</p>
            <p>I used to work at Kroger, but stopped due to Band complications, I now currently am employed under Culver's.</p>
            <p>I have been on a few family vacations, but nothing to insanely interesting, We've been to Florida to see family, Arizona to see my brother, and Colorado to meet with our cousins half way. We have gone to Chicago a few insances.</p>
            <p>The most daring thing I have ever done was skip band practice to go to a Oliver Tree Concert. 100 percent worth it, would do it a million and one times over again, those boys I went with are family to me.</p>

            <h1>Chess Board Puzzle:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Concept: The players walk into a room with a massive life-size checkerboard. Once a player steps on the board, they are transported to a normal-sized chessboard on the table in the room. They then have to play chess to get out, and unlock the door.</li>
                <li>Room Dimensions: 16 ft by 16 ft</li>
                <li>Danger: If a player is captured by a piece of the other side, they will be sent to a prison cell on the board.</li>
                <li>Setup: Varies based on the spot they step on. is always a possible position to win from starting out.</li>
                <li>Solution: If a player makes it to the other side of the board without getting their piece captured by the opposing colour, they are released from the board and a door opens.</li>
                <li>Hints to understand: <ul><li>Arcana checks: Tell the player the board on the ground is likely magical, and seems to have a teleportation spell attatched. they may also be able to tell a runic connection between the ground board and the chessboard on the table in the corner of the room.</li> <li>A perception check will alow the player to notice a shape in the wall that appears to be a door, however there doesnt seem to be any door mechanisms on it. There appears to be some connection between the chessboard and the door. they may also notice there doesnt appear to be any white pieces in the room.</li></ul></li>

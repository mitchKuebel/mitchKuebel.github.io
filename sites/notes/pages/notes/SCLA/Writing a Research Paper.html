                            <p>- Ancient Civilizations did not leave documents, this causes us to have to put their knowledge and their culture into our own words.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>- Logic of practice</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- If you know how to do something sub-consciously, it becomes extremely difficult to describe, and explain how to do something to someone else</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Something that is like riding a bike, or learning an instrument, or to dance, etc, is not something that can be learned solely by theory. By looking at an instruction, or theory, you wont be able to do something in practice.</div><div><br></div><div>- Logic of Logic (Reason)</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- When talking about logic by logic, this is more of a liberal arts way of thinking, instead of a more scientific route</div><div><br></div><div>Scientific papers Vs Liberal Arts</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Science</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Empirical, Facts, Experiments, Towards Theoretical Solutions, Mathematics, Study of Nature, Physical Phenomena, Beyond Intuitive Common Sense.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Liberal Arts</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Semi-Empirical, Textual Facts, Interpretation, Toward Theory, Exposing Complexities and Paradoxes, Study of Human Beings, Human Phenomena and Sensibilities.</div><div><br></div><div>We all have opinions, but we have to figure out where the opinions come from. Almost everyone who has a faith, is their parents faith. It is very rare to see someone who split from their parents faith.</div><div><br></div><div>In movies there are no accidents, so someone creating an essay wants to frame all the lens to explain how things work from all the needed angles.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Use the Youtube Commentary Rule. If you look up your point and see everyone else already talked about it, pick a new point, OR if you think that you have something NEW to bring to the table.</div></p>

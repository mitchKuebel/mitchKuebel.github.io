This could also be emails or stuff.</div><div>This is called a Knowledge based system, (Knowledge management)</div><div>&lt;ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Uses a knowledge base and inference rules&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Knowledge base Large database that allows users to find information by entering keywords&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Inference rules: identify data patterns and relations&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ul&gt;</div><div><br></div><div>System integation:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lot of companies have glued together their systems, which allow holes to appear in data, and things will have the opportunity to be lost</div><div>When two systems are trying to talk to each other, integration is needed, companies need to&nbsp; be able to work together to allow this</div><div><br></div><div>Organization Information models:</div><div>&lt;ol&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Top Managers, Such as Todd Kuebel, is much more secluded from the IT section. They more manage the company, making sure it stays afloat.&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Middle managers are going to be further separated from the more IT level of the company, and rather work more in people management&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Team leaders also do this but they work more into the higher vision of the play&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;When thinking aboout IT, you have operational employees, who work on tickets, and work with customers.&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ol&gt;</div><div>These levels all have different organizational needs and different things they need to see. For instance, If the president of Purdue got a note on their desk saying your name, thats not something you wnt, it either means you did something really good or really bad. However you do want it on your professors desk because that is like- the class youre taking?</div><div><br></div><div>Coming out into the field with the experience we have, it would make sense to take an operational member position at apple, but maybe not so much at a smaller business. I should be able to be be a middle manager level, or maybe even my own company (techlocity part 2)</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Structured analysis&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Used Systems development life cycle (SDLC)&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Plan, Analyze, Design, Implement, and support systems&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;these are like gates, you have to have each stage done before moving to the next&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Agile Methods&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Build a series of prototypes and constantly adjuss them to user requiremants&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;This more relies on getting customer input&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;li&gt;Spiral Method&lt;/li&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ul&gt;</div><div>&lt;/ul&gt;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The book has stuff about emerging trends, however he thinks we are more in touch with that than the book</div><div><br></div></p>
